Simultaneously, we are committed to advancing global economic prosperity by promoting financial inclusion, security, autonomy, asset ownership, and the regulatory compliance thereof.

<p>Our overarching vision was formed against the backdrop of the rapidly accelerating arrival of the quantum and photonic computing era. With great humility, we postulated the rapid acceleration of quantum computing advancement could significantly impact public blockchains and public key encryption 2 plus years before a Ripple mathematician concluded the same according to a May 2024 CoinTelegraph article. And prior to Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin's October 18, 2023 statement indicating the sudden arrival of the quantum era would necessitate a hard fork of the Ethereum blockchain and, thus, from our perspective, jeopardize the integrity and continuity of not only the Ethereum blockchain, but public blockchain technology in its entirety. Buterin's admittance is proof that the significance of quantum computing as it relates to public blockchain technology has been largely understated. Thus, we firmly believe it is time to decisively reevaluate our trajectory and consolidate our collective vision before quantum advantage becomes the next ChatGPT like technological explosion. With the recent release LightSolvers' desktop size, laser powered computer benchmarking in line and, at times ahead, of the fastest classic and quantum computers on the market, time is unquestionably of the essence. </p>
